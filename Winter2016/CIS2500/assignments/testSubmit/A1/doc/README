Compilation
***********

In order to compile the program use Terminal to
navigate inside the directory containing the program
 file (&&&&&).  Then use the following command:

gcc &&&&&& -std=c99 -Wall

*****
Usage
*****

To run the program, while inside the same directory as
before which will now contain an a.out executable file,
use this command:

./a.out templateFile.txt dataFile.txt outputFile.txt

*******
Testing
*******

Testing was conducted on the files included in the assets
folder (templateFile.txt, dataFile.txt, and outputFile.txt).

Testing was also conducted on variations of theses files
where some variables were misspelled in order to test the
case where variables were not found in the data file.

*****************
Known Limitations
*****************

Known limitations of this program are:

1.  If the order of the arguments when executing the program
are not consistent with template file, then data file, followed
by the output file, then the program will not function properly.

2.  If the variables in the template file are not in the
format: {variableName}, they will not be read properly 
by the program, and so will not be changed to the corresponding
value in the hash map.

3.  If the variables in the data file are not in the format:
variableName=variable value<newline>, the keys and values will
not be read in properly by the program, and so not stored properly
in the hash table for use in the program.
