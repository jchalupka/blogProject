Dear Fork,
I understand that we haven’t spoken since I ran away with Cup…

But I thought you should know that we have a son.
His name is Spork.  He has your hair.

Sincerely,
Spoon

I have added some additional text to this document.

If any of you know the where about of my MISSING_DATA that would be great.
